- simply change the mag_in and SN_in vector (vector because all filters are always calculated at the same time), then texp, Npeak, Nsky are calculated

- if you select tel="WST 2m defocussed", then an example for defocussed images is calculated...

- you can also specify texp_in and mag_in then SN will be calculated and so on...
